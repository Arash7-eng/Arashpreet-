Hello everyone! Today is my first day in college whose name is "Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College ". Yesterdays night is very uncomfortable for me because i have feared about tomorrow means at present today. what is happening that day . I got up early in the morning and do my all routine. Then i go to college and approach here . Then i find gurudwara sahib because all functions are started from there 
then i find gurudwara sahib there is 9:00 clock and that's a final time to go there according to schedule. I wash my hands and put my slippers in to the shoes rank where is located outside the gurdwara sahib. Then i go inside tge gurdwara sahib and in the presence of "Guru Granth Sahib " i pray for myself and my all friends who are started there journey of b tech in different branches. 


**Shabad Kirtan**

There is now 9:00 clock and the kirtan is started and all listen and close there eyes. Then after sometime kirtan is ended and ardas started . After that i eat parsad . 

**Lunch**

After shabad kirtan all go outside the gurudwara sahib for there lunch . lunch is looking very yummy but there are some my health issues so I don't take luncb because it is almost oily food here. Then i will started walking to go auditorium.

**Attendance**

There is a time to sign our attendance. Firstly i see on notice board and find my name then i go to first table to sign my attendance and one mam is sitting there and she give me a  file and then i go inside . In the front of the auditorium there is a very nice welcome fram and rangoli which is looking adorable.
